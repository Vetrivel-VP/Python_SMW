Tuple:
    It is ordered and unchangeable
    It alaways enclosed inside the ()
Converting to List:
    If you want to update a tuple the only way is to convert them to a list, then update your value. Finally convert your value to 
    tuple again
        List : list() constructor
        Tuple : tuple() constructor


Sets:
    It is unordered and unindexed. We used to write sets inside the curely brackets {}

    add()           : Helps to add new elemet to a set 
    update()        : To add multiple elements
    discard()       : Remove an element by a value.
        The difference between the remove() and discard().
            remove() : Raise an error if an element is not exists.
            discard() : Doesn't raise an error if the element is not exists

Dictionary:
    It is unordered , changeable and indexed. We use the curely brackets. We the key and value pair combination.

    values() : Returns the values of the Dictionary
    items()  : Returns the both key and value pair
    get()    : Single element value from the list
    popitem() : Last inserted element from the Dictionary
    pop() : Removes the value only which you specified

        Syntax:
            dict_name = {
                key : value,
                .
                .
                
            }
