Run the following command in your command prompt
Open The run window:
	win Key + R
	Type cmd (For opening Command Prompt)

	3. Python file
	
dir : List of directories in your current folder.
cd	: change your directory
		cd 'directory_name'
	come out : cd ..

Datatypes:
	Data is an information.
	
	Python Datatypes:
		Integer
		Decimal
		String
		Character
		
Variables:
	Helps you to organise the data. To access and to retrive or to save in you memory space.
	Two types:
		Static Variable
		Dynamic Variable
	
	Static:
		Constant variable, which cannot be updated during the runtime of your program.
	
	Define Static variable:
		Syntax:
			variable_name = value
	Conditions for Variable Name:
		Dont use Keywords for the variable name.
		It can alphanumeric.
		We can't start with numbers, we need to start with alphabets.
		Don't leave any unwanted space and don't use any special characters.
		
		Wright			Wrong
		ab				a b
		a_b				a-b
		a2				2a
		_a				$a, a$
		
	eg:
		a = 5						Memory Space
									Address			Variable_name			value
									FF675				a					  5
									G678				b					  10
	Interpreter:
		Compile and execute the code by line by line
	
	Types:
		Cpython			: Compilled by C Interpreter	: Object Code
		JPython			: Java Compillor				: Byte Code (JVM- Java Virtual Machine)
		IronPython		: C# (Sharp) Compillor
		PyPy			: Subprogram of python 
		

											
Prifixed the print function with f'' - Formatted string , r'' - Raw String		
		Value of Variables: Enclose that variable name {}
		
	
Dynamic:
	These variables are not constant, they can be updated during the runtime of your program.
	input() : Reads the input from the user but by default it reads the input from the user in string Datatype
	Typecasting:
		Converting string to primitive or primitive to string.

		int() : Convert a Datatype to an interger
		float() : Convert a Datatype to a float
		str()	: Convert a Datatype to string
		eval() 	: Evaluate the input and connvert it to the respective Datatype either int or float

	Syntax:
		variable_name = input()


Write a program to find Total & Average of a student 
Output:
	Enter the student Name:Sample
	Enter Marks m1,m2,m3,m4,m5 : 55,55,55,55,55
	Name : Sample, Total : 275, Average : 52.5%
