Polymorphism:
    Greek term  : 
        Poly : Many 
        Form : Shapes
    Many shapes or many forms

    A function can act in more than one form.

Types:
    Compile Time
    Run Time

compile Time :
    It is achieved during the compilation. It is achieved by the Function Overloading.

    Function Overloading:
        Function name should be same
        Either a function parameter or the function return type should be different.

            Parent                  Child
        FirstClass              SecondClass
            run()                     run()

    is-A 

    ob = SecondClass()
    
    ob.run()
    ob.run()
    on.run()
    on.run()

    Runtime Polymorphism:
        Achieved by the function overriding during the run Time
    
    Conditions:
        Function name, parameter, return datatype everything should be same.

    
Encapsulation:
    Hiding the implementation of the class properties. By making your members private.
    Access Modifiers:
        private, public, protected, default.

    In python, __variable_name
