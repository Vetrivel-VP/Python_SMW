Function:
    The function is helps you to repeat a certain line of codes again and again during the runtime of your program.
    It is always followed by the ().
Types:
    1. Pre-defined Functions
    2. User-defined Functions
    3. Parameterized Functions

Pre-defined:
    Already defined in your library packages, like print(), eval(), input()...

User-Defined:
    We are creating our own function for own program. def is a keyword, helps you to define a new function.

    Syntax:
        def variable_name():
            statements

    Once you finished the function, leave an empty line to make sure that python can understand that the function is 
    finished here.
    To execute the function, you need to call the function to be executed. Untill calling it manually it doesn't executed.

    To call:
        variable_name()

main = Every program has it own function or a module name called main : That means this function instructing the
interpreter to be start executing this function first

__name__ : Every package or python source code hase __name__

__main__ : Main module (Python)

if __name__ == "__main__":


Parameterized Function:
    Exactly same as your user-defined function. It caries an input value and returns an output. By the calling the function
    I send an input and that function will process that input and producess some output.

Types:
    Function with parameters, without return statements.
    Function without parameters, but with return statements.
    Function with parameters and with return statements.

    When a function returning an output we need to catch that output from the same place, where you called that function.

Escape sequence:
    I'm print('I\'m')
    \n : New line
    \t : Tab
