Condition Statements:
    Condition Statements helps you to check a condition, and then it returns the boolean value.

Conditional Statements in python
    If, If else, If elif ...else, nested If

Logical Operators:
    =                       assignment operator
    ==                      equivalent operator
    <                       lesser than
    >                       greater than
    <=                      lesser than or equals
    >=                      greater than or equals
    and                     AND gate
    or                      OR gate
    .                       Dot Operator

Arithmetic Operators:
        +,-,*,/
    

If Condition
    This Statement check a condition, if the condition is satisfied it will be executed.

    Synatx:
        if (condition):
            true_statement


If Else Statement
    Its return the false Statement also

    Synatx:
        if (condition):
            true_statement
        else:
            false_statement

1. Write a program to find Voter Id Elgibility check
1. Read the age of the candidate
2. Check candidate age is greater than or equal to 18
3. True : Eligible to Voter
   False: Not Eligible to vote 

Output:
    Enter the vandidate age: 19
    Eligible to vote
2. Write a program to find even or not even.
    To check the reminder : %
    1. Read a number
    2. Check the reminder of that number is equals to 0 when dividing it by 2
    3. Equals 0     : ( Given number ) is an Even Number
    4. Not Equals 0 : ( Given number ) is not an Even Number
 Output
    Enter a number: 5
    5 is not an even number


If elif ....else
        It works in a sequential order, executes the condition one by one
    Syntax:
        if condition 1 :
            true_statement_1
        elif condition 2:
            true_statement_2
            .
            .
        else:
            false_statement
eg:
    Grade System.
    45 - 55  : C Grade
    56 - 65  : B Grade
    66 - 75  : A Grade
    76 - 100 : A+  
    Other    : Fail
    AND Gate
        Intersection in SETS
        A   B   AB
        1   1   1
        1   0   0
        0   1   0
        0   0   0
    OR Gate
        A   B   AB
        1   1   1
        1   0   1
        0   1   1
        0   0   0

    tab = \t (Escape Sequence)
    new line = \n


Nested If :
    Having a complete if condition inside another one if condition
    Syntax:
        if condition:
            if condition 2 :
                true_statement_2
            else:
                false_statement_2
        else:
            false_statement_1
